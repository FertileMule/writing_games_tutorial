As promised, let's now take a look at the problem of how adding of features 
causes our event handling function to get hairier than the warmest yeti.

[TODO: maybe a note about how if you're really looking for quick development
and don't want see the steps or the rationale, you can skip to the end of 
this chapter for a complete event manager module]

----

def handle_events(clock):
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == c.QUIT:
            return False
        elif event.type == c.MOUSEBUTTONDOWN:
            for sprite in sprites:
                if isinstance(sprite, Monkey):
                    sprite.attempt_punch(event.pos)

    clock.tick(60) # aim for 60 frames per second
    for sprite in sprites:
        sprite.update()

----

We can see that this function grows in complexity as 3 other things increase:
event sources (places that events come from)
event types
event listeners (places where events need to be sent)

----

def handle_events(clock):
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == c.QUIT:
            return False
        elif event.type == c.MOUSEBUTTONDOWN:
            for sprite in sprites:
                if isinstance(sprite, Monkey):
                    sprite.attempt_punch(event.pos)
        elif event.type == event_type_B:
            for sprite in sprites:
                if isinstance(sprite, Trap):
                     ...
        elif event.type == event_type_C:
            ...
        elif event.type == event_type_D:
            ...

    clock.tick(60) # aim for 60 frames per second
    for sprite in sprites:
        sprite.update()

    for event in some_other_events():
        ...

    specialEvent = from_somewhere()
    for sprite in sprites:
        sprite.do_special()

----

Remember our two tools when faced with complexity: organization and abstraction.
Let's use some abstraction.  We can move from handling each sink, source,
or event type in it's own specific block of code to a single block of code that
treats them generally.

Start with the event sources.  We can see 4 different sources above, two
we've seen before, pygame.event.get(), and clock.tick()/sprite.update(), as
well as two new ones that exist just to provide an example of how the event
sources might grow, some_other_events() and from_somewhere()/do_special().

In general, all 4 do the same thing: generate events that must be sent
to the listeners.  So let's group them into a function.

----
def generate_events(clock):
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        yield event

    clock.tick(60) # aim for 60 frames per second
    yield 'ClockTick'

    for event in some_other_events():
        yield event

    specialEvent = from_somewhere()
    yield 'SpecialEvent'


def handle_events(clock):
    for event in generate_events(clock):
        if event == 'ClockTick'
            for sprite in sprites:
                sprite.update()
        elif event == 'SpecialEvent'
            for sprite in sprites:
                sprite.do_special()
        ... # handle those events that came from some_other_events()
        elif event.type == c.QUIT:
            return False
        elif event.type == c.MOUSEBUTTONDOWN:
            for sprite in sprites:
                if isinstance(sprite, Monkey):
                    sprite.attempt_punch(event.pos)
        elif event.type == event_type_B:
            for sprite in sprites:
                if isinstance(sprite, Trap):
                     ...
        elif event.type == event_type_C:
            ...
        elif event.type == event_type_D:
            ...
----

This generate_events() function is a little ugly, because it returns two types
of object and relies on the caller to know how to handle them.  So let's 
address the complexity caused by multiplying event types next.  Here's how
to treate each event type in a general way:

----
class Monkey(pygame.sprite.Sprite):
    ...
    def on_event(self, event):
        if event == 'ClockTick'
            self.update()
        elif event == 'SpecialEvent'
            self.do_special()
        ... # handle those events that came from some_other_events()
        elif event.type == c.MOUSEBUTTONDOWN:
            self.attempt_punch(event.pos)
        # notice that Monkey doesn't do anything on event_type_B
        elif event.type == event_type_C:
            ...
        elif event.type == event_type_D:
            ...

class Trap(pygame.sprite.Sprite):
    ...
    def on_event(self, event):
        if event == 'ClockTick'
            self.update()
        elif event == 'SpecialEvent'
            self.do_special()
        ... # handle those events that came from some_other_events()
        # notice that Trap doesn't do anything on MOUSEBUTTONDOWN
        elif event.type == event_type_B:
            self.add_some_honey()
        elif event.type == event_type_C:
            ...
        elif event.type == event_type_D:
            ...

def handle_events(clock):
    for event in generate_events(clock):
        for sprite in sprites:
            sprite.on_event(event)

----

Now we have *more* lines of code.  Have we gone backwards?  Not really.  
Remember, we are trying to come up with a good way to deal with increasing
complexity.  If we add 10 more events that only affect Monkeys, the only
place we need to add more code will be in the Monkey class.  The Trap class
and the handle_events() function will be unaffected.

So the increase of event types destined for specific classes has been
addressed, but what about event types that apply to many classes.  An example
of such an event is what is now the 'ClockTick' string.  Every sprite will
conceivably need to call update() when it receives a 'ClockTick'.

We can use some of the language features that make Python so joyous to 
solve this issue:
[TODO: talk about the features we're about to use in a general sense, and address possible resistance]

----
class EventHandlingSprite(pygame.sprite.Sprite):
    def on_ClockTick(self):
        self.update()
    def on_Special(self):
        ...

class Monkey(EventHandlingSprite):
    ...
    def on_PygameEvent(self, event):
        if event.type == c.MOUSEBUTTONDOWN:
            self.attempt_punch(event.pos)
        elif event.type == event_type_C:
            ...
        elif event.type == event_type_D:
            ...

class Trap(EventHandlingSprite):
    ...
    def on_PygameEvent(self, event):
        if event.type == event_type_B:
            self.add_some_honey()
        elif event.type == event_type_C:
            ...
        elif event.type == event_type_D:
            ...

def generate_events(clock):
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        yield ('PygameEvent', event)

    clock.tick(60) # aim for 60 frames per second
    yield ('ClockTick', )

    for event in some_other_events():
        yield (event.__class__.__name__, event)

    specialEvent = from_somewhere()
    yield ('SpecialEvent', )

def handle_events(clock):
    for eventTuple in generate_events(clock):
        for sprite in sprites:
            methodName = 'on_' + eventTuple[0]
            if hasattr(sprite, methodName)
                method = getattr(sprite, methodName)
                methodName(*eventTuple[1:])
----

This was a big change, so let's examine it step by step.  First, look at the
generate_events() function.  Now, instead of yielding two different types,
either a string or some event instance, it consistently yields tuples.
Every tuple has a string as its first argument. The string is a somewhat
descriptive name for the event.

This name gets consumed by the handle_events() function, which prefixes it
with "on_".  For example, it takes "ClockTick" and creates the string
"on_ClockTick".  It then looks for a method matching that name in every sprite.
If it finds one, it calls the method, using the remaining items inside the
tuple as arguments.  For example, when it calls on_PygameEvent(), it uses 
the event as an argument.

We see that on_PygameEvent() has been implemented in both the Monkey and
Trap classes.

Since on_ClockTick() and on_Special() will do the same thing to
either a Monkey or a Trap, a new superclass is created to avoid duplicating
those methods in both the Monkey and Trap classes.

One change remains, the treatment of events that come from some_other_events().
Let's assume that such events are proper Python instances and we can access
their magic __class__ attribute (we can't do this with Pygame events).  When
this is the case, we don't need to come up with our own descriptive string,
we can just use __class__.__name__.

So if some_other_events() is extended to return events of a new class, "Foo",
we don't need to change generate_events() or handle_events(), we just need to
add a on_Foo() method to one of our sprite classes.  The dark forces of 
Complexity are truly cowering now.

[TODO: Aside - discuss the possible infinite loop if some_other_events() was
a generator that could get new events as listeners processed events]

Next, let's address the growth of event listeners.  We've already taken care 
of the addition of new sprites with our earlier changes, but what if we want
other types of objects to listen to events?  For example, a log file object.
Simply add a data structure that collects all the listeners.

While making this change, let's also notice that our function, handle_events()
is no longer doing any *handling* of the events. So it will be renamed
dispatch_events() to more accurately reflect what it does.

----
listeners = []

def init():
    # Necessary Pygame set-up...
    pygame.init()
    clock = pygame.time.Clock()
    displayImg = pygame.display.set_mode(screenDimensions.size)
    monkey = Monkey()
    sprites.add(monkey)
    listeners += sprites

    return (clock, displayImg)

def dispatch_events(clock):
    for eventTuple in generate_events(clock):
        for listener in listeners:
            methodName = 'on_' + eventTuple[0]
            if hasattr(listener, methodName)
                method = getattr(listener, methodName)
                methodName(*eventTuple[1:])
----

Now hopefully your organizational instincts are telling you that with our
handful of functions and a module-level data structure that are all
inter-related, it is a good time to encapsulate them into their own module.
[TODO: talk about Mediator pattern here?]

Your instincts may also have been keeping you annoyed by the passing of the
Pygame clock object two levels deep, from dispatch_events() to 
generate_events().  The next change will address this as well.
